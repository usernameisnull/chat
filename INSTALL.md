# Installing Tinode

## Installing from Binaries

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/tinode/chat/releases/), choose the latest or otherwise the most suitable release. From the list of binaries download the one for your database and platform. Once the binary is downloaded, unpack it to a directory of your choosing, `cd` to that directory.

2. Make sure your database is running. Make sure it's configured to accept connections from `localhost`. In case of MySQL, Tinode will try to connect as `root` without the password. See notes below (_Building from Source_, section 4) on how to configure Tinode to use a different user or a password. MySQL 5.7 or above is required. MySQL 5.6 or below **will not work**.

3. Run the database initializer `init-db` (or `init-db.exe` on Windows):
	```
	./init-db -data=data.json
	```

4. Run the `tinode` (or `tinode.exe` on Windows) server. It will work without any parameters.
	```
	./tinode
	```

5. Test your installation by pointing your browser to http://localhost:6060/


## Docker

See [instructions](./docker/README.md)


## Building from Source

1. Install [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install). Make sure Go version is at least 1.9. Building with Go 1.8 or below **will fail**!

2. Make sure either [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/) or MySQL (or MariaDB or Percona) is installed and running. MySQL 5.7 or above is required. MySQL 5.6 or below **will not work**. MongoDB (v4.2 and above) also available but it is experimental on not tested in production.

3. Fetch, build Tinode server and tinode-db database initializer:
 - **RethinkDb**:
	```
	go get -tags rethinkdb github.com/tinode/chat/server && go build -tags rethinkdb -o $GOPATH/bin/tinode github.com/tinode/chat/server
	go get -tags rethinkdb github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db && go build -tags rethinkdb -o $GOPATH/bin/init-db github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db
	```
 - **MySQL**:
	```
	go get -tags mysql github.com/tinode/chat/server && go build -tags mysql -o $GOPATH/bin/tinode github.com/tinode/chat/server
	go get -tags mysql github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db && go build -tags mysql -o $GOPATH/bin/init-db github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db
	```
 - **MongoDB**:
	```
	go get -tags mongodb github.com/tinode/chat/server && go build -tags mongodb -o $GOPATH/bin/tinode github.com/tinode/chat/server
	go get -tags mongodb github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db && go build -tags mongodb -o $GOPATH/bin/init-db github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db
	```
 - **All** (bundle all the above DB adapters):
	```
	go get -tags "mysql rethinkdb mongodb" github.com/tinode/chat/server && go build -tags "mysql rethinkdb mongodb" -o $GOPATH/bin/tinode github.com/tinode/chat/server
	go get -tags "mysql rethinkdb mongodb" github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db && go build -tags "mysql rethinkdb mongodb" -o $GOPATH/bin/init-db github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db
	```

	Note the required **`-tags rethinkdb`**, **`-tags mysql`** or **`-tags mongodb`** build option.

	You may also optionally define `main.buildstamp` for the server by adding a build option, for instance, with a timestamp:
	```
	-ldflags "-X main.buildstamp=`date -u '+%Y%m%dT%H:%M:%SZ'`"
	```
	The value of `buildstamp` will be sent by the server to the clients.


4. Open `tinode.conf`. Check that the database connection parameters are correct for your database. If you are using MySQL make sure [DSN](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name) in `"mysql"` section is appropriate for your MySQL installation. Option `parseTime=true` is required.
```js
	"mysql": {
		"dsn": "root@tcp(localhost)/tinode?parseTime=true",
		"database": "tinode"
	},
```

5. Make sure you specify the adapter name in your `tinode.conf`. E.g. you want to run Tinode with MySQL:
```js
	"store_config: {
		...
		"use_adapter": "mysql",
		...
	},
```

6. Now that you have built the binaries, follow instructions in the _Running a Standalone Server_ section.

## Running a Standalone Server

1. Make sure your database is running:
 - **RethinkDB**: https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/start-a-server/
	```
	rethinkdb --bind all --daemon
	```
 - **MySQL**: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-startstop-excerpt/5.7/en/programs-server.html
	```
	mysql.server start
	```
 - **MongoDB**: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

    MongoDB should run as single node replicaset. See https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/replica-set-deployment/
	```
	mongod
	```

2. Run DB initializer
	```
	$GOPATH/bin/init-db -config=$GOPATH/src/github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db/tinode.conf
	```
	add `-data=$GOPATH/src/github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db/data.json` flag if you want sample data to be loaded:
	```
	$GOPATH/bin/init-db -config=$GOPATH/src/github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db/tinode.conf -data=$GOPATH/src/github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db/data.json
	```

	DB intializer needs to be run only once per installation. See [instructions](tinode-db/README.md) for more options.

3. Unpack JS client to a directory, for instance `$HOME/tinode/webapp/` by unzipping `https://github.com/tinode/webapp/archive/master.zip` and `https://github.com/tinode/tinode-js/archive/master.zip` to the same directory.

4. Run the server
	```
	$GOPATH/bin/tinode -config=$GOPATH/src/github.com/tinode/chat/server/tinode.conf -static_data=$HOME/tinode/webapp/
	```

5. Test your installation by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:6060/](http://localhost:6060/). The static files from the `-static_data` path are served at web root `/`. You can change this by editing the line `static_mount` in the config file.

**Important!** If you are running Tinode alongside another webserver, such as Apache or nginx, keep in mind that you need to launch the webapp from the URL served by Tinode. Otherwise it won't work.


## Running a Cluster

- Install and run the database, run DB initializer, unpack JS files as described in the previous section. Both MySQL and RethinkDB supports [cluster](https://www.mysql.com/products/cluster/) [mode](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/start-a-server/#a-rethinkdb-cluster-using-multiple-machines). You may consider it for added resiliency.

- Cluster expects at least two nodes. A minimum of three nodes is recommended.

- The following section configures the cluster.

```
	"cluster_config": {
		// Name of the current node.
		"self": "",
		// List of all cluster nodes, including the current one.
		"nodes": [
			{"name": "one", "addr":"localhost:12001"},
			{"name": "two", "addr":"localhost:12002"},
			{"name": "three", "addr":"localhost:12003"}
		],
		// Configuration of failover feature. Don't change.
		"failover": {
			"enabled": true,
			"heartbeat": 100,
			"vote_after": 8,
			"node_fail_after": 16
		}
	}
```
* `self` is the name of the current node. Generally it's more convenient to specify the name of the current node at the command line using `cluster_self` option. Command line value overrides the config file value. If the value is not provided either in the config file or through the command line, the clustering is disabled.
* `nodes` defines individual cluster nodes. The sample defines three nodes named `one`, `two`, and `tree` running at the localhost at the specified cluster communication ports. Cluster addresses don't need to be exposed to the outside world.
* `failover` is an experimental feature which migrates topics from failed cluster nodes keeping them accessible:
  * `enabled` turns on failover mode; failover mode requires at least three nodes in the cluster.
  * `heartbeat` interval in milliseconds between heartbeats sent by the leader node to follower nodes to ensure they are accessible.
  * `vote_after` number of failed heartbeats before a new leader node is elected.
  * `node_fail_after` number of heartbeats that a follower node misses before it's considered to be down.

If you are testing the cluster with all nodes running on the same host, you also must override the `listen` and `grpc_listen` ports. Here is an example for launching two cluster nodes from the same host using the same config file:
```
$GOPATH/bin/tinode -config=./tinode.conf -static_data=./webapp/ -listen=:6060 -grpc_listen=:6080 -cluster_self=one &
$GOPATH/bin/tinode -config=./tinode.conf -static_data=./webapp/ -listen=:6061 -grpc_listen=:6081 -cluster_self=two &
```
A bash script [run-cluster.sh](./server/run-cluster.sh) may be found useful.

### Enabling Push Notifications

Follow [instructions](./docs/faq.md#q-how-to-setup-fcm-push-notifications).

### Note on Running the Server in Background

There is [no clean way](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/227) to daemonize a Go process internally. One must use external tools such as shell `&` operator, `systemd`, `launchd`, `SMF`, `daemon tools`, `runit`, etc. to run the process in the background.

Specific note for [nohup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup) users: an `exit` must be issued immediately after `nohup` call to close the foreground session cleanly:

```
nohup $GOPATH/bin/server -config=$GOPATH/src/github.com/tinode/chat/server/tinode.conf -static_data=$HOME/tinode/webapp/ &
exit
```

Otherwise `SIGHUP` may be received by the server if the shell connection is broken before the ssh session has terminated (indicated by `Connection to XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX port 22: Broken pipe`). In such a case the server will shutdown because `SIGHUP` is intercepted by the server and interpreted as a shutdown request.

For more details see https://github.com/tinode/chat/issues/25.
