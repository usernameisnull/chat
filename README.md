# Tinode Instant Messaging Server

Instant messaging server. Backend in pure [Go](http://golang.org) (license [GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)), client-side binding in Java for Android and Javascript (license [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)), persistent storage [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/), JSON over websocket (long polling is also available). No UI components other than demo apps. Tinode is meant as a replacement for XMPP.

Version 0.9. This is alpha-quality software. Bugs should be expected. Follow [instructions](INSTALL.md) to install and run. Read [API documentation](API.md).

A javascript demo is (usually) available at http://api.tinode.co/x/example-react-js/ ([source](https://github.com/tinode/example-react-js/)). Login as one of `alice`, `bob`, `carol`, `dave`, `frank`. Password is `<login>123`, e.g. login for `alice` is `alice123`. [Android demo](https://github.com/tinode/android-example) is mostly stable and functional. See screenshots below.


## Why?

[XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) is a mature specification with support for a very broad spectrum of use cases developed long before mobile became important. As a result most (all?) known XMPP servers are difficult to adapt for the most common use case of a few people messaging each other from mobile devices. Tinode is an attempt to build a modern replacement for XMPP/Jabber focused on a narrow use case of instant messaging between humans with emphasis on mobile communication.
